Implementation of Uploadify in Rails3 + crop in Ajax.

Run the seeds and visit http://localhost:3000/profiles/new

(it's NOT a social app so user model is a fake as well as profile)

Uploadify works well for multiple files handling. 
- in profiles/_form, set multi to true
- in pictures controller, remove the test of previous picture existence in create

You'll see that all pictures are stored (I didn't bothered to display them for now)
