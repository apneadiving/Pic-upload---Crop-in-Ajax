== Branch Master:

using: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload

Still in heavy dev, works fine only on Mac/chrome now.


== Branch Uploadify:

Implementation of Uploadify in Rails3 + crop in Ajax.

=== To make it work:
- Run the seeds
- visit http://localhost:3000/profiles/new

Uploadify works well for multiple files handling. 
- in profiles/_form, set multi to true
- in pictures controller, remove the test of previous picture existence in create

You'll see that all pictures are stored (I didn't bothered to display them for now)

=== More info:
I added 'ADD THIS' in the relevant files
It's NOT a social app so user model is a fake as well as profile
